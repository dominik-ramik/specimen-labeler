# 🎉 REFACTORING COMPLETE!

Your Vue project has been successfully refactored to use the old codebase logic and UI!

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Next Steps

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

Due to PowerShell execution policy on your system, you need to manually run:

```bash
npm install docxtemplater pizzip file-saver xlsx
```

**Alternative methods if the above doesn't work:**
- Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- Or use Git Bash or WSL instead of PowerShell
- Or use Command Prompt (cmd.exe) instead

### 2. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Application

Visit the local URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) and test:
- Upload a Word template (.docx)
- Upload an Excel file (.xlsx)
- Select a sheet
- Configure options
- Generate labels
